PseudoID was developed by Tamas Spisak and Robert Englert (PNI-lab, University Hospital Essen). The proposed pseudonymization workflow is a result of a joint effort of members of the central scientific projects of SFB289 (Ulrike Bingel, Christian BÃ¼chel, Winfried Rief, Manfred Schedlowski and Tamas Spisak) and implements insights from several PIs of SFB289.
